                        and has transformed my life completely so much so that I'm myself aiming to become a person and a teacher like her :)

                        I remember myself always dreading about being called up by the teacher to say something in front of the whole class. 
                        I used to find excuses and run away in such situations and never thought I would be able speak aloud in front of a group of strangers. 
                        But entering Genesis and finding Divya ma’am was the first step I took to overcome my fear. 
                        The teachers here, especially Divya Khanna, acted as a trailblazer for me and made me realise that running away is not a solution and facing your fear is. 
                        That’s what I did- faced, fought and won against my fear of stage. Today, without any hesitation, I can present myself and my views in front of innumerable people. 
                        Divya ma’am has played a major role in remoulding my personality and I am forever grateful to her !

                        Everyone needs a mentor like like Divya Mam in their life. 
                        She did not teach us for the sake of getting good grades in exam but also taught us how to speak confidently. 
                        She worked really hard on our grammer skills which was pretty messed up. 
                        She taught us how to write articles and letters that would make an impact. 
                        I would highly recommend the students to go for this course.

                        English was a tricky subject for me, with too many compound rules to remember. I was looking for a brilliant English coach who could simplify all the difficult concepts for me. Someone told me that Divya ma'am at Genesis Educates could solve all my problems related to the language. I went there for a trial class and was amazed by her way of teaching English. I joined her class during my preparation for the 12th CBSE board exams. Even though it was a crash course, she managed to teach me all the composite rules with ease and helped me improve my language, and I scored 91 in my board exams and a 7.5 band in my IELTS exam. Divya ma'am is not only the best English teacher but the best trailblazer. She doesn't just believe in teaching the subject she aims to help the students become a better version of themselves. She helped me every time I was in a dilemma, whether it was related to the subject or a real-life situation. She believes in you, pushes you, picks you up when you are down, and is there to help you every time. She is simply the best human being I have ever met. She has helped me become an improved version of myself. I'm trying to explain her contribution in my life which cannot be explained in words or in any way.

                        Being a student of genesis since class 9th, I am pleased as punch to find my trailblazer Ms. Divya Khanna who is full of enthusiasm, zest, and, energy. She immensely believes in the law of attraction. This trait in her makes her a spectacular mentor & a life coach, who isn't biased with any student based on their academic success. Divya ma'am always guides me to have a tenacious and positive approach to life. Throughout, she has inspired me to be a better version of myself every day. I am thankful for all the educational as well moral lessons she has taught. Her life mantra is to make a comeback after a failure which helps me to associate more and more with her.
